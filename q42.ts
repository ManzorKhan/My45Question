//Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.

// create an array of magicians names
let magicians1: string[] = [`mustafa`, `Ali`, `sohail`,];

function show_magicians(magicians1: string[]): void {
    magicians1.forEach(magician1 =>
        console.log(magician1));
    }


    function make_great(magicians1: string[]): void {
        for (let i = 0; i < magicians1.length; i++) {
          magicians1[i] = "the great " + magicians1[i];
    }

    }
    // call make_great() to modify the array of magicians
    make_great(magicians1);

    // call show_magicians() to see that list has been modified
    show_magicians(magicians1);



    show_magicians(magicians1);
